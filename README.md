## Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was built to help me understand some of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I have added notes as I built it to refer back and add to in the future.

## Installation

No installation required

## Usage

To use this study guide and what to study first you need to open DevTools in Chrome. This can be done by right clicking the page then selecting "inspect". This can also be achieved by using the crtl+shift+I on windows and command+option+I on Mac. There are notes for each section that highlight important coding fundmentals of each language used.
